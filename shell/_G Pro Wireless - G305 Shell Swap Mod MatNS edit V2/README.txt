Summary:
This is my edit of Wiyum's G Pro Wireless - G305 Shell Swap Mod. For more information, and assembly instructions go here:https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4603475Update: This is V2 of my edit based on Wiyum's V3 model. To print the new version download the files with v2 in the name. There is also a step file for side buttons, if you need to edit side buttons placement. The weight of the mouse from the pictures is 58.36gThis is a list of changes that are added to my edit:~ a little bit thicker, and stronger top mesh on the top shell~ the design near power switch is diferent, so you can see it it's on or off,~ added the mesh on the bottom, where possible~ redesigned scroll wheel holder~ redesigned side buttonsThe changes from V1 listed below are also added to the v2 with acception of keeping the charging port open.V1:This is a list of changes that I made:Top cover~dpi button mount, and hole is removed~charging port is covered by a very thin layer (if you decide to use it it's very easy to cut out)~gap on the top, where left and right buttons are conected is filledBottom~added place for G305 feet~added some empty hexes under the pcb to keep the weight downSide buttons~their placement is a bit diferent. If you need to modify them to fit your mouse I added Fusion 360 fileThe DPI cover is not needed for my shell. It can be used for Wiyum's top cover if you don't want to use this button (not functional, just to patch the hole)In the files you can also find unmodified mount for switches.Some of the changes on the top cover are not perfect- you can see where I patched the holes, but this imperfections can be easily sanded. I will be working on this in the future.To find more information on my mouse finish go to:https://www.reddit.com/r/MouseReview/comments/kxunxi/g305_to_g_pro_mod/If you are searching for AAA battery holder for your G305 mod here is my make:https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4725120
